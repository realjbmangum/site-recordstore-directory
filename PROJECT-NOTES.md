## Project Vision

### The Problem
Finding quality independent record stores is harder than it should be. Google Maps shows locations but lacks:
- Genre specialties (jazz? metal? hip-hop? rare imports?)
- Crate-digging intel (new arrivals, rare finds)
- Community knowledge (owner recommendations, hidden gems)
- Event info (in-store performances, RSD exclusives)

### The Solution
A passion-driven directory that goes deeper than competitors. Not just "here's a store" but "here's why you should visit, what you'll find, and what makes it special."

### Core Principles
1. **Depth over breadth** - Start local, do it better than anyone
2. **Authentic voice** - Written by collectors, for collectors
3. **Community-first** - Build relationships with stores and collectors
4. **SEO-driven growth** - Content that ranks and serves real needs
